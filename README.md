## Steps to download ROS

First we download VirtualBox 

Open-source and cross-platform: VirtualBox is free and open-source software, meaning you can download, use, and modify it without any cost. It's also available for multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

To download VirtualBox, you can visit the official VirtualBox website (https://www.virtualbox.org) and navigate to the Downloads section. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system, download the installer, and follow the installation instructions to set it up on your computer.

Then we download Ubuntu 

Ubuntu has a vast software repository, known as the Ubuntu Software Center, which offers a wide range of free and open-source software applications. You can find popular software such as web browsers, office suites, media players, development tools, and more, all easily installable with just a few clicks.

To download Ubuntu, you can visit the official Ubuntu website (https://ubuntu.com) and navigate to the Downloads section. Choose the appropriate version (usually based on your computer architecture) and follow the instructions to download the ISO file. Once the ISO file is downloaded, you can create a bootable USB or DVD and install Ubuntu on your computer.

we can install robotic arm packages from https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm

after that open VirtualBox then file - import and select ros file
